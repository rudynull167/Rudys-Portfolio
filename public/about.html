<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Rudy Null I am a software developer with a Bachelors Degree in information sciences and technology from Penn State University. 
I currently work in the manufacturing industry and work on many exciting projects related to AI and software development.
</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies include snowboarding, photography, and art. What I plan to do in the future is to expand my skills in AI
  and web3 development. I am very passionate about technology and how you can use it as a creative tool to expedite and simplify processes.
  I also am excited about decentralized platforms and I am looking forward to the future with web3 development and it's implementaion in the coming years.
</p>

<p>Some more background of what I've been doing in the past years: I started out of highschool by enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in their aerospace propulsion career path.
  I was stationed at Macdill Air Force Base in Tampa Florida for my first assignment/ duty station. During my time there I worked as a flightline jet engine mechanic.
  This consisted of troubleshooting and maintaining KC135 aircraft and I specifically worked on the CFM-56 Turbofan engines. This gave me a mechanical aptitude and an understanding
  of how mechanical components work together in a system. That being the propulsion system. I've traveled to Texas, California, and Kansas when I was stateside in the U.S. and 
  I did one tour to Qatar for 6 months in an expeditionary assignment to do my job overseas in the Middle East. In 2020 when I was 21 years old I decided to pursue college
  and my passion for technology, and in 2024 earned my bachelors degree. With my background I intend to use my software and mechanical system knowledge to drive technological innovation 
  in the manufacturing industry.
